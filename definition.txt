if range is distant then action is donothing
if health is uninjured AND rating is not hard then action is attack
if rating is hard AND health is not uninjured then action is flee
if health is neardeath OR health is critical then action is flee
if health is not neardeath AND health is not critical AND rating is not hard then action is attack
